# Why no 286 or 808x?
Me, the very owner has a answer. You can't blame me with this reason, so know that.
286 and 808x are the most focused emulated CPUs in emulators, PCem and 86box have the default machine config set on them too.
It's also not worth trying to try and emulate these processors onto pentiumemu since 86box has support for atleast 5 OSes and it just conquers the emulation popularity section. I Have no chance of trying to emulate these processors. And 286 processors simply are garbage. The BIOS is garbage. The Comfortability is garbage. and the whole i286 project is just straight up uncompatabile stuff. They sometimes will not even boot from A: or C:. There you go.
